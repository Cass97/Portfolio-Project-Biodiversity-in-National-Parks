# Portfolio-Project-Biodiversity-in-National-Parks
Open-ended capstone project for the Codecademy "Data Science Foundations" Course. I was provided with two csv files containing information on different species in American national parks. I engaged mostly with the process of data wrangling and handling duplicate data, but also completed some exploratory data analysis. This project demonstrates my skills in Python, particularly the Pandas and Seaborn libraries.
